Researcher and technical expert with experience in cybersecurity, data privacy,
human-computer interaction, analysis of network data, computer science
research, and social science research. I build technical tools and collect data
about how people use technology, and use that data to develop new insights,
theories, and knowledge.  I regularly communicate complex technical and
scientific concepts to broad, cross-disciplinary audiences.  My cybersecurity
work has received attention and awards for its quality and impact from other
academics, from industry, and from government.

Teaching Experience
-------------------

#### Classes Taught

I've taught over 25 courses at MSU, and received positive reviews for all of
them.  Most recently, I taught "Introduction to Applied Programming",
"Cybersecurity and Human Behavior", "Methods for Understanding Users", and
"Statistical Analysis for Media Research".  I have extensive experience
explaining highly technical information to multiple audiences in an
understandable manner, and relating technical details to higher-level concerns
like business models, legal issues, and societal welfare.  Full details are
available on my [C.V.](https://rickwash.com/cv.html)


#### Students Advised

I've advised, mentored, and trained many students over my career.  Most
importantly, I've worked with 2 postdoctoral researchers, graduated 2 PhD
advisees, served on 27 PhD student committees, advised 7 masters students, and
worked directly with over 40 undergraduate research assistants in both computer
science and social science areas. I have worked to intentionally recruit
students from under-privileged backgrounds and who are underepresented in
computing research.  Full details are available on my
[C.V.](https://rickwash.com/cv.html)

#### Informal Education

I regularly provided training and education in informal settings about
technical issues.  I've written articles for the general public that describe
how research results can help them [protect themselves from
phishing](https://theconversation.com/you-know-how-to-identify-phishing-emails-a-cybersecurity-researcher-explains-how-to-trust-your-instincts-to-foil-the-attacks-169804)
or [understand complex new
technologies](https://theconversation.com/behind-the-crypto-hype-is-an-ideology-of-social-change-177981).
I've provided phishing training to univerity students, extension workers,
groups of knowledge workers, and (through media interviews) the general public.

Scholarly Service
-----------------

I am an active member of the scientific research community, and am particularly
active around cybersecurity research and human-computer interaction research.
Most recently, I am the program co-chair and steering committee member for
SOUPS (the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security) and an associate editor
for the Journal of Cybersecurity.  I have been an active reviewer, program
committee member, and associate chair for diverse research venues such as ACM
CHI, ACM CSCW, Usenix Security, WEIS, etc.


I was also an external expert consultant for [CitizenLab Security
Planner](https://securityplanner.org/) (now run by Consumer Reports), the
[Cyber Security Body of Knowledge](http://www.cybok.org) (Human Factors
Knowledge Area reviewer), and was an invited expert at the US Federal Trade
Commission's [Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/ftc-hearing-competition-consumer-protection-21st-century-december-2018)
