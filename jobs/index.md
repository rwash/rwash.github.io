Job Package
===========

*My job search was successfully concluded with a tenure-track position at
Michigan State University.  I leave this page available so others can see my job
search materials and hopefully learn from them.*

I am currently looking for a tenure track faculty position related to HCI, CSCW,
Social Media, and Social Computing at a competitive research university. 

Right now, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of
Telecommunications, Information Studies, and Media at Michigan State University.
I recently received my PhD from the School of Information at the University of
Michigan.  My advisor was Jeffrey MacKie-Mason.

### Research and Teaching Interests

I often see people discussing how to build social media systems; indeed, many
classes are taught on the subject.  Most of these discussions focus on technical
features: database design, REST APIs, explicit social networks, tags, etc.  But
building a social media system also means designing the desired social
behaviors: contributing articles, updating statuses, rating posts, and
commenting. Facebook wouldn't be interesting without regular 'status updates'
from a wide variety of people. In my research, I identify incentive mechanisms:
technological design patterns that lead to predictable, desirable behavior.
Having a toolbox of incentive mechanisms allows us to move from building
technical systems to engineering socio-technical systems. Identifying these
causal relationships also allows us to better understand the use of these
systems, and the effects these systems have on their users.

To identify and characterize incentive mechanisms, I draw on theories of
motivation and incentives from human-computer interaction, economics,
communications, and social psychology to understand, explain, and then predict
behavior of users.   I combine these theories with my computer science
background to identify and design technical features that can reliably induce
desired behaviors across a wide variety of computer systems.  I use this
interdisciplinary approach because these systems are inherently socio-technical;
their effectiveness depends critically on both the social behavior and the
technical design of the system. I use a variety of approaches to study incentive
mechanisms in social media; my research includes economic modeling, quantitative
server log analysis, both lab and field experiments, and qualitative inquiry.

In addition to my research, I am also in teaching topics related to my research.
In particular, I would be interested in teaching classes about how technology
and social behavior combine to form valuable systems.  This involves teaching
classes on technology, such as web programming and UI design.   It also involves
teaching classes on social behavior, such as classes on information economics or
theories of motivation and behavior.  It also, of course, involves teaching
classes at this interesting intersection of technology and behavior: classes on
social computing/social media, media effects, incentives in social computing,
CSCW, etc.  I also have experience teaching classes related to practicing these
skills, such as project management.
