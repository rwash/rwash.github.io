Every three years, the [Symposium on Usable Security and
Privacy](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2017) selects a paper for its
"Impact" award.  This award is given to a paper published at SOUPS between 5
and 10 years ago that has shown a lasting impact on the community.

My [Folk Models of Home Computer Security](/papers/conference/folk-models-soups.html) 
paper was selected as one of the four finalists for this award.
