I will be serving on two conference program committees related to computer security this year:

* [Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security 2012](http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2012/); Washington, DC, July 11-13
* [Workshop on the Economics of Information Security 2012](http://weis2012.econinfosec.org/); Berlin, Germany, June 25-26 

I strongly encourage you to submit to either or both of these conferences; they are both excellent conferences.
