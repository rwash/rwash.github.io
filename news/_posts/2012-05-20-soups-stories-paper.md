Emilee Rader, Brandon Brooks, and I recently conducted a study of how non-experts tell stories about security incidents
and security threats. We believe that these stories are one of the major ways that people learn how to manage the
security of their computer. And indeed, we found that people reported learning a bunch from these stories, and changing
their behavior as a result of hearing the stories.
