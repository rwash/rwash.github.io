I have just been awarded a grant for $515,987 from the National Science
Foundation.  The project is to examine how stories about past incidents can be
used to help people make better computer security decisions in-the-moment.
These decisions include things like "is this email a phishing message?" and
"should I click through this SSL warning?" and I believe that hearing a variety
of stories from others in similar situations can help people learn to make
these decisions faster and more accurately. 

The project is titled "SaTC: CORE: Small: Using Stories to Improve Computer
Security Decision Making" and will start on August 15, 2017 and continue until
at least 2020.  It is being conducted in partnership with MSU IT Services and
the MSU Chief Information Officer.
