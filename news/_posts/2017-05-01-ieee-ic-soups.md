IEEE Internet Computing just published a [special issue](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ic/2017/03/index.html) based
on recent papers published at the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS).  Mary Ellen Zurko and I served as
guest editors for this special issue, and were responsibility for soliciting papers, coordinating reviewing, and
selecting the final set of papers that were published.  We also wrote an
[introduction](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ic/2017/03/mic2017030019-abs.html) the that describes current issues
in the area and the papers selected.
