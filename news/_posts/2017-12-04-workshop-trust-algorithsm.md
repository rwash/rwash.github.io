The Workshop on Trustworthy Algorithmic Decision-Making seeks to bring together
scholars to identify future research opportunities and suggests plans and
research ideas for making the use of algorithms in society more trustworthy.
It was held on December 4-5, 2017 in Arlington, VA, and was attended by 40
leading scholars, industry researchers, and government researchers.  A
whitepaper discussing the outcomes of the workshop is currently planned.
