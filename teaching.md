Rick's Classes
--------------

I teach a number of classes at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels.  In general, I am interested in the social
and technical aspects of information and communication technologies.  I teach classes in the areas of Social Computing,
Social Media, Information Security, Technology and Journalism, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Computer Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW).

### Currently Teaching (Spring 2017)

* **MI 985**: Analysis for Media

### Past Classes

#### Building Online Communities

*TC 491, JRN 492*

Students will learn how to create an online community of people focused around
a specific topic, including setting up the server technology, recruiting
participants, motivating contributions, and dealing with unwanted content.  The
class will form cross-disciplinary teams that will spend a semester creating
and growing an online community.  This will represent a new type of education
in journalism that will bring students into new, community-driven methods of
doing journalism, based more on curating content and facilitating discussion
than on original, unidirectional reporting.  Students in the class will be
taught to apply social science and computer science research for real-world
applications and how to work on collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams that
include both technical and creative people as well as topic experts.

*Schedule: Fall 2014, Fall 2015, Fall 2016*

#### Server Side Web Development

*TC 449, TC 359*  

This undergraduate class teaches the basics of server-side web application development using Ruby and the Rails
framework. By the end of the class, students will be able to develop and deploy a modern web application with both
server-side programming and client-side displays, including persistent data storage and dynamically generated webpages.
This is a programming class, but does not presume that the student has much programming background; an understanding of
basic world wide web technologies such as HTML is required.

*Schedule: Spring 2010, Spring 2011, Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2014*

#### Large Scale Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (Big Data)

*CAS 992*

This special-topics class is a doctoral level methods class that looks at doing research using large quantities of real
world data. We will cover a number of topics throughout the semester, mostly focusing on developing research skills to
do this type of research. We will cover how to find and collect large samples of data, how to process, parse, munge, and
store that data in a database. And then we will learn how to analyze this data and why the analysis is different than
the analysis of more traditional data like that from experiments.

*Schedule: Fall 2011, Fall 2013*

#### The Future of News / Social Media News and Information

*JRN 492, JRN 892, JRN 821*

This special topics class (which is now a required masters class) is at least as much about the future of journalism as
it is about computing technology. With a large majority of Americans using at least one, and often more than one,
computer on a daily basis, computers have fundamentally changed the way we produce and consume journalism. From speeding
up the news cycle to changing the way news is delivered to publicly and globally commenting on news stories, consumers
have used computing technology to change their relationship with the news. And at the same time reporters and
journalists have found equally valuable used for computers, from improved workflow to better sources to analyzing big
data.

This class is about all of these changes. In this class, we will explore and discuss how technology has evolved, and how
the field of journalism has (in the past) and can (in the future) use that technology to improve. There will be a lot of
discussion amongst the class about ways that we can use these technologies to improve our reporting. Both undergraduates
and graduate students are welcome.

*Schedule: Spring 2011, Spring 2013, Spring 2015, Spring 2016*

#### Analysis for Media

*TC 985* renamed to *MI 985*

This class is a doctoral level methods class where we learn a number of statistical techniques for analyzing
quantitative data that arises in doing research on media and information. The majority of this class will focus on
interpretation of statistical results: given data with certain properties, how do you interpret the results of
statistical calculations to understand what you can learn from various types of analysis. We will also focus on using
statistics to answer how much questions rather than just simply yes/no questions. We will cover a variety of analyses
that come up in research in our field, including linear regression, logistic regression, poisson regression, multi-level
models and random effects, causal interpretation, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Depending on time,
we may also cover model comparison, sample size and power calculations, and ANOVA.

*Schedule: Spring 2012, Spring 2013, Spring 2014, Spring 2015*

#### Information Networks and Technology

*TC 861*

This masters level class covers the basics of telecommunications technology: how does information reliably get from
point A to point B in today's world? We cover physical transmission media, the OSI 7-layer model of responsibility, and
many different network protocols. We put a particularly strong emphasis on understanding how these technical details
impact telecommunications businesses and all kinds of business decisions.

*Schedule: Fall 2010*

#### Methods for Understanding Users

*MI 220*

This undergraduate class introduces students to the basics of understanding users of technology systems, with the
eventual goal of creating new design ideas.  We cover a number of formative HCI methods including contextual inquiry,
affinity diagrams, field observations, surveys, and diary studies.  This class also introduces students to careers in
HCI.

*Schedule: Fall 2016*
