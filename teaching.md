Rick's Classes
--------------

*Note: This information is out of date*

I teach a number of classes at the undergraduate, masters, and PhD levels.  In general, I am interested in the social
and technical aspects of information and communication technologies.  I teach classes in the areas of Social Computing,
Social Media, Information Security, Technology and Journalism, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Computer Supported
Cooperative Work (CSCW).

### Currently Teaching (2020-2021)

* **MI 250**: Introduction to Applied Programming

### Past Classes

#### Introduction to Applied Programming
*MI 250*

This course is a first introduction to computer programming, designed for
students who will not become professional programmers but who will need to use
technical skills or interact with programmers. That is, the course helps
students understand how to think about programming computers, and builds some
basic skills at getting computers to do what they want them to do, without an
expectation that they go on to take large numbers of future programming courses
or work professionally doing programming.

Everyone can learn to program. Everyone. And understanding more about how
computers work, how programmers work, and what is easy vs hard for computers
are extremely useful skills. Those skills are valuable for people doing
analytics, graphic design work, creating user experiences, building games, and
almost anyone who works with computers as part of their job. This course tries
to help students build computer programming skills that they can immediately
apply to interesting problems and use in their other endeavors.

#### Analysis for Media

*TC 985* renamed to *MI 985*

The [replication crisis](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716) in psychology has caused many people to
question much of the research in the social sciences.  While there are many reasons for this crisis, a number of people
are pointing at inadequate and poorly conducted statistical analysis -- and particularly the emphasis on Null Hypothesis
Testing -- as one of the major problems.  This course teaches students the foundations of many common statistical
techniques in the social sciences.  It emphasizes statistical and analytical techniques that hold up under scrutiny and
promote high quality social scientific inquiry.

While most of the time in the course is spent conducting and interpreting common statistics like t-tests and
regressions, this class focuses attention not on *which* statistic is being used, but instead on how the statistics
provide insight into the world and can be used to make strong arguments about social scientific concepts. I emphasize
concepts like thinking about how good your measurements are, understanding the units of your variables, thinking about
effect sizes instead of statistical significance, using statistics to answer "how much?" questions instead of "yes/no"
questions, how statistical models provide control, and how to ensure that your analysis and results can be reproduced
and replicated. In doing so, I will discuss a variety of statistical tools that are used in the social sciences,
including t-tests, chi-squared tests, anova, OLS regression, logistic regression, multi-level models, statistics to make
causal claims, and structural equation modeling.

After completing this course, students will have a strong foundation in statistics that will allow them to conduct
high-quality statistical analyses of social scientific research.  This foundation should provide them with an
understanding of what statistical analysis in the social sciences will be like in their careers in the future. This
foundation will also prepare them to learn more advanced analytical techniques, such as big data analysis, structural
equation modeling, causal analysis, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, machine learning, and econometrics.

*Schedule: Every Spring, 2012-2018*

#### Building Online Communities

*TC 491, JRN 492*

Students will learn how to create an online community of people focused around
a specific topic, including setting up the server technology, recruiting
participants, motivating contributions, and dealing with unwanted content.  The
class will form cross-disciplinary teams that will spend a semester creating
and growing an online community.  This will represent a new type of education
in journalism that will bring students into new, community-driven methods of
doing journalism, based more on curating content and facilitating discussion
than on original, unidirectional reporting.  Students in the class will be
taught to apply social science and computer science research for real-world
applications and how to work on collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams that
include both technical and creative people as well as topic experts.

*Schedule: Fall 2014, Fall 2015, Fall 2016*

#### Methods for Understanding Users

*MI 220*

This undergraduate class introduces students to the basics of understanding users of technology systems, with the
eventual goal of creating new design ideas.  We cover a number of formative HCI methods including contextual inquiry,
affinity diagrams, field observations, surveys, and diary studies.  This class also introduces students to careers in
HCI.

*Schedule: Fall 2016, Fall 2017, Fall 2018, Fall 2019*


#### Server Side Web Development

*TC 449, TC 359*  

This undergraduate class teaches the basics of server-side web application development using Ruby and the Rails
framework. By the end of the class, students will be able to develop and deploy a modern web application with both
server-side programming and client-side displays, including persistent data storage and dynamically generated webpages.
This is a programming class, but does not presume that the student has much programming background; an understanding of
basic world wide web technologies such as HTML is required.

*Schedule: Spring 2010, Spring 2011, Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2014*

#### Large Scale Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (Big Data)

*CAS 992*

This special-topics class is a doctoral level methods class that looks at doing research using large quantities of real
world data. We will cover a number of topics throughout the semester, mostly focusing on developing research skills to
do this type of research. We will cover how to find and collect large samples of data, how to process, parse, munge, and
store that data in a database. And then we will learn how to analyze this data and why the analysis is different than
the analysis of more traditional data like that from experiments.

*Schedule: Fall 2011, Fall 2013*

#### The Future of News / Social Media News and Information

*JRN 492, JRN 892, JRN 821*

This special topics class (which is now a required masters class) is at least as much about the future of journalism as
it is about computing technology. With a large majority of Americans using at least one, and often more than one,
computer on a daily basis, computers have fundamentally changed the way we produce and consume journalism. From speeding
up the news cycle to changing the way news is delivered to publicly and globally commenting on news stories, consumers
have used computing technology to change their relationship with the news. And at the same time reporters and
journalists have found equally valuable used for computers, from improved workflow to better sources to analyzing big
data.

This class is about all of these changes. In this class, we will explore and discuss how technology has evolved, and how
the field of journalism has (in the past) and can (in the future) use that technology to improve. There will be a lot of
discussion amongst the class about ways that we can use these technologies to improve our reporting. Both undergraduates
and graduate students are welcome.

#### Information Networks and Technology

*TC 861*

This masters level class covers the basics of telecommunications technology: how does information reliably get from
point A to point B in today's world? We cover physical transmission media, the OSI 7-layer model of responsibility, and
many different network protocols. We put a particularly strong emphasis on understanding how these technical details
impact telecommunications businesses and all kinds of business decisions.
