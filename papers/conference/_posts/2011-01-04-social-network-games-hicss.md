Social network games embedded within social network sites (SNSs) such as Facebook facilitate play with "Friends" within
the SNS. In this study, we look at different dimensions of how game play contributes to relationship initiation and
development using qualitative data collected from adult Facebook users (N=18). Our data suggest that interpersonal
motivations are a primary driver of initial game play and that while game play doesn't facilitate direct social
interaction, participants perceived indirect interaction and sharing game-based content was useful in maintaining and
even enhancing relationships.
