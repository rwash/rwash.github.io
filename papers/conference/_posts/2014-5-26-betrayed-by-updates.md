Installing security-relevant software updates is one of the best computer protection mechanisms.  However, users do not
always choose to install updates.  Through interviewing non-expert Windows users, we found that users frequently decide
not to install future updates, regardless of whether they are important for security, after negative experiences with
past updates. This means that even non-security updates (such as user interface changes) can impact the security of a
computer.  This update behavior is becoming increasingly important as devices move toward an ``app'' model for software
distribution and updates.
