Home computer systems are insecure because they are administered by untrained users.  The rise of botnets has amplified
this problem; attackers compromise these computers, aggregate them, and use the resulting network to attack third
parties.  Despite a large security industry that provides software and advice, home computer users remain vulnerable.
I identify eight 'folk models' of security threats that are used by home computer users to decide what security software
to use, and which expert security advice to follow: four conceptualizations of 'viruses' and other malware, and four
conceptualizations of `hackers' that break into computers.  I illustrate how these models are used to justify ignoring
expert security advice.  Finally, I describe one reason why botnets are so difficult to eliminate: they cleverly take
advantage of gaps in these models so that many home computer users do not take steps to protect against them.

*Update* (Jul 13, 2017): The SOUPS community has chosen this paper as a finalist for the [Impact award](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2017), 
given every three years to the paper with a strong long-term impact on the community.
