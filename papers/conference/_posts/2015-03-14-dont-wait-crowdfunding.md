Crowdfunding sites often impose deadlines for projects to receive their
requested funds. This deadline structure creates a difficult decision for
potential donors. Donors can donate early to a project to help it reach its
goal and to signal to other donors that the project is worthwhile. But donors
may also want to wait for a similar signal from others.

We conduct an experimental simulation of a crowdfunding website to explore how
potential donors to projects make this decision. We find evidence for both
strategies in our experiment; some donate early while others wait till the last
second. However, we also find that making an early donation is usually a better
strategy for donors because the amount of donations made early in a project’s
campaign is often the only difference between that project being funded or not.
This finding suggests that crowdfunding sites need to develop designs, policies
and incentives that encourage people to make immediate donations so that the
site can most efficiently fund projects.
