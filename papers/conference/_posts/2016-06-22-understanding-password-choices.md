From email to online banking, passwords are an essential component of modern
internet use.  Yet, users do not always have good password security practices,
leaving them vulnerable to online attacks.  We conducted a study which combines
self-report survey responses with measures of actual online behavior gathered
from 134 participants over the course of six weeks.  We find that people do
tend to re-use each password on 1.7--3.4 different websites, their reused
passwords tend to be stronger than other passwords, and mostly they tend to
re-use passwords that they have to enter frequently.  We also investigated
whether self-report measures are accurate indicators of actual behavior,
finding that though people understand password security, their self-reported
intentions have only a weak correlation with reality. These findings suggest
that users manage the challenge of having many passwords by choosing a strong
password on a website where they have to enter it frequently in order to
memorize that password, and then re-using that strong password across other
websites.
