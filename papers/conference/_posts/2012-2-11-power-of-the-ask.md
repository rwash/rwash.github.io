Social computing and social media systems depend on contributions from users.  We posit the existence of a latent demand
for contribution: many users want to contribute but don't.  We then test a simple interface that can induce these users
to actually contribute: we display a popup window asking users to contribute.  In a real-world randomized field
experiment, we found that asking them to contribute right now is ineffective, but reminding the users to contribute
actually leads to approximately a 23% increase in contributions with no reduction in quality.   However, this effect
wanes as users habituate to the popups.
