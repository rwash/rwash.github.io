Collaborative tagging systems have the potential to produce socially constructed information organization schemes. The
effectiveness of tags for finding and re-finding information depends upon how individual users choose tags; however,
influences on users' tag choices are poorly understood. We quantitatively test competing hypotheses from the literature
concerning these choices, using data from del.icio.us (a collaborative tagging system for organizing web bookmarks) and
a computer model of possible tag choice strategies. We find evidence that users choose tags in a pattern consistent with
personal information management goals, rather than as a result of social influence.
