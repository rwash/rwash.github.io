Fledgling online communities often hope to achieve *critical mass* so that
the community becomes sustainable. This concept however is not well understood.
At what point does a community achieve critical mass, and how does the
community know this? Furthermore, online communities become sustainable when
they achieve a mass of what? We explore this question by analyzing growth in a
large number of online communities on Wikipedia. We find that individual
communities often have different patterns of growth of membership from its
pattern of growth of contribution or production. We also find that in the early
stages of community development, building membership has a greater impact on
community production and activity in later periods than accumulating many
contributions early on, and this is especially true when there is more
diversity in the early participants in a community. We also show that
participation from a community's "power users" in its early stage is not as
valuable to sustainability as the collective contributions of those who make
only small contributions. We argue that critical mass is established by
developing a diverse set of community members with heterogeneous interests and
resources, and not purely by accumulating content.
