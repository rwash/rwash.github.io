Home computers are frequently the target of malicious attackers because they
are usually administered by non-experts. Prior work has found that users who
make security decisions about their home computers often possess different
mental models of information security threats, and use those mental models to
make decisions about security. Using a survey, we asked a large representative
sample of United States Internet users about different causal beliefs related
to computer security, and about the actions they regularly undertake to protect
their computers. We found demographic differences in both beliefs about
security and security behaviors that pose challenges for helping users become
more informed about security.  Many participants reported weakly held beliefs
about viruses and hackers, and these were the least likely to say they take
protective actions. These results suggest that all security knowledge is not
the same, educating users about security is not simply a more-is-better issue,
and not all users should receive the same messages.
