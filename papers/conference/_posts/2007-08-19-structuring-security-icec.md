Humans are "smart components" in a system, but cannot be directly programmed to perform; rather, their autonomy must be
respected as a design constraint and incentives provided to induce desired behavior. Sometimes these incentives are
properly aligned, and the humans don't represent a vulnerability. But often, a misalignment of incentives causes a
weakness in the system that can be exploited by clever attackers. Incentive-centered design tools help us understand
these problems, and provide design principles to alleviate them. We describe incentive-centered design and some tools it
provides. We provide a number of examples of security problems for which Incentive Centered Design might be helpful. We
elaborate with a general screening model that offers strong design principles for a class of security problem
