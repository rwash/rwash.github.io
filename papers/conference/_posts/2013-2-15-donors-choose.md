Crowdfunding systems are social media websites that allow people to donate small amounts of money that add up to fund
valuable larger projects. These websites are structured around projects: finite campaigns with well-defined goals, end
dates, and completion criteria. We use a dataset from an existing crowdfunding website -- the school charity Donors
Choose -- to understand the value of completing projects. We find that completing a project is an important act that
leads to larger donations, greater likelihood of returning to donate again, and few projects that expire close but not
complete. A conservative estimate suggests that this completion bias led to over $15 million in increased donations to
Donors Choose, representing approximately 16% of the revenue for the period under study. This bias suggests that
structuring many types of collaborative work as a series of projects might increase contribution significantly.
