We explore an alternative approach to spam based on economic rather than technological or regulatory screening
mechanisms. We employ a model of email value which supports two intuitive notions: 1) mechanisms designed to promote
valuable communication can often outperform those designed merely to block wasteful communication, and 2) designers of
such mechanisms should shift focus away from the information in the message to the information known to the sender. We
then use principles of information asymmetry to cause people who knowingly misuse communication to incur higher costs
than those who do not. In certain cases, though not all, we can show this approach leaves recipients better off than even
an idealized or "perfect" filter that costs nothing and makes no mistakes. Our mechanism also accounts for individual
differences in opportunity costs, and allows for bi-directional wealth transfers while facilitating both sender signaling
and recipient screening.
