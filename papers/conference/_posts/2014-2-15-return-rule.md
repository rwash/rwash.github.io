Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter, Spot.Us and Donor's Choose seek to fund multiple projects simultaneously by
soliciting donations from a large number of donors.  Crowdfunding site designers must decide what to do with donations
to projects that don't reach their goal by the deadline. Some crowdfunding sites use an all-or-nothing *return
rule* in which donations are returned to donors if a project doesn't meet its goal. Other sites use a *direct
donation* structure where all donations are kept by the project even if the total is insufficient. 

We simulated a crowdfunding site using a threshold public goods game in which a set of donors tries to fund multiple
projects that vary in riskiness. We find that the return rule mechanism leads to a marginal improvement in productivity
of a site -- more money is donated in total -- by eliciting more donations. However, the return rule also leads to a
potential loss in efficiency (percentage of projects funded) because donations become *spread* across too many
projects and are not coordinated to achieve the maximum possible impact. The direct donation model, though, encourages
donors to coordinate to creates a more efficient but slightly less productive marketplace.
