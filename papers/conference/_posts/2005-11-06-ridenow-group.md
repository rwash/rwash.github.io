The RideNow Project is designed to help individuals within a group or organization coordinate ad hoc shared rides. This
paper describes three design decisions the RideNow team made in order to allow incremental adoption and evolution and to
capitalize on local conditions. (1) The system allows users to interact with the system through email or Web, because we
anticipate that email will be most convenient when there are few users but the Web interface will be more useful as the
number of users increase. (2) The system does not force structure on user-entered data such as dates, times, and
locations, instead allowing conventions to emerge. (3) We use the groupâ€™s shared physical spaces to provide additional
information about ride sharing activity.
