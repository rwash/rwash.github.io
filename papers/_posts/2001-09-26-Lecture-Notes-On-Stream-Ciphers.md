In these notes I explain symmetric key additive keystream ciphers, using as an
example the cipher RC4. I discuss a number of attack models for this class of
ciphers, using attacks on RC4 as examples. I cover a number of attacks on RC4,
some of which are effective against implementations of RC4 used in the real
world.
