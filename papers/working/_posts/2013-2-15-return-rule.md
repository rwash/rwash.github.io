Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter, Spot.Us and Donor's Choose are marketplaces that seek to match creators of
public goods projects to donors with preferences for seeing those projects completed. The efficiency of these markets is
hindered by complementarities in the preferences of both donors and project creators: creators prefer multiple donors to
completely fund their project, and donors prefer to contribute to projects that will be completely funded. Some
crowdfunding sites employ a return rule in which donations to projects that do not reach their self-imposed fundraising
goal are returned to the donors. Other sites use a direct donation structure where all donations are kept by the project
even if the total is insufficient.

We simulated a crowdfunding site using a threshold public goods game in which a set of donors tries to fund multiple
projects that vary in riskiness. We find that the return rule has two important effects on a crowdfunding market. First,
the return rule leads to improved efficiency over the direct donation model by eliciting more donations from the site's
visitors than under the direct donation model. This efficiency, however is offset by market spread: donations are
spread out across more projects, reducing the likelihood that any individual project is funded. Under direct donation,
donors implicitly coordinate on low-risk projects; the return rule removes that coordination, complicating the
complementarity problem in crowdfunding.
