Social computing systems collect, aggregate, and share user-contributed content, and therefore depend on contributions
from users to function properly. However, humans are intelligent beings and cannot be programmed to behave; system
designers must provide incentives to encourage users to contribute. We explore the behavioral consequences of one simple
incentive mechanism: require users to contribute a minimum amount of information before they are granted access to the
system. Users with a high marginal cost of contribution will stop using the system, but users with a moderate marginal
cost will increase their contribution, frequently leading to greater benefits for everyone still using the system.
Additionally, if contributions are collaborative and build upon each other, then existing contributors are likely to
slightly decrease their contributions, leading to a more 'equal' distribution of contributions. We show that this
mechanism often leads to increased contributions, and provide concrete design advice for using this mechanism in social
computing systems.
