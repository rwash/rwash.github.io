Passwords are one of the most common security technologies that people use ev-
eryday. Choosing a new password is a security decision that can have important
consequences for end users. Passwords can be long and complex, which
prioritizes the security-focused aspects of a password. They can also be simple
— easy to create, remember and use — which prioritizes the usability aspects of
the password. The trade-off between password security versus usability
represents competing constraints that shape password creation and use. We
examined an ecologically valid dataset of 853 passwords entered a total of 2533
times by 134 users into 1010 websites, to test hypotheses about the impact of
these constraints. We found evidence that choices about password complexity
reflect an emphasis on security needs, but little support for the hypothesis
that users take day-to-day ease of use of the password into account when
creating it. There was also little evidence that password creation policies
drive password choices.
