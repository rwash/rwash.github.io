Computer users have access to computer security information from many different sources, but few
people receive explicit computer security training. Despite this lack of formal education, users
regularly make many important security decisions, such as "Should I click on this potentially shady
link?" or "Should I enter my password into this form?" For these decisions, much knowledge
comes from incidental and informal learning. To better understand differences in the
security-related information available to users for such learning, we compared three informal
sources of computer security information: news articles, web pages containing computer security
advice, and stories about the experiences of friends and family. Using an LDA topic model, we found
that security information from peers usually focuses on who conducts attacks, information containing
expertise focuses instead on how attacks are conducted, and information from the news focuses on the
consequences of attacks. These differences may prevent users from understanding the persistence and
frequency of seemingly mundane threats (viruses, phishing), or from associating protective measures
with the generalized threats the users are concerned about (hackers). Our findings highlight the
potential for sources of informal security education to create patterns in user knowledge that
affect their ability to make good security decisions.
