Online simulation games provide an opportunity for people to express their personality through the design of their
in-game virtual environment in a manner visible to third-party observers. We found that zero-acquaintance observers of
these games can identify personality traits by simply looking at screenshots of the created virtual environment, and
that the observed personality is closer to the self-reported "real" personality than "ideal" personality of the
creator. These results contradict studies on avatar customization and personality, suggesting that spatial
customization is more reflective of unintentional behavioral residue than conscious selective self-presentation.
