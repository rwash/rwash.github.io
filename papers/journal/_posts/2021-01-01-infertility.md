Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to
undertake some action they normally would not.  While technical protections against phishing reduce the number of
phishing emails received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest sources of security risk in
technology and communication systems.  To better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to identify
phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in
their own inboxes.  IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process for identifying phishing emails. In the first
stage, the email recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it relates to other things in their
life.  As they do this, they notice discrepancies: little things that are ``off'' about the email. As the recipient
notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an alternative explanation for the email.  At some point, some feature
of the email --- usually, the presence of a link requesting an action --- triggers them to recognize that phishing is a
possible alternative explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and investigate the email by looking
for technical details that can conclusively identify the email as phishing.  Once they find such information, then they
move to stage three and deal with the email by deleting it or reporting it.  I discuss ways this process can fail, and
implications for improving training of end users about phishing.
