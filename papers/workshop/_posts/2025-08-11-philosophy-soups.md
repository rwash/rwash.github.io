"Cybersecurity" and "security" seem roughly synonymous, and in a large part of
the cybersecurity literature they are treated that way. However, there are
multiple domains in which security is important, and cyber is only one of them.
We compare cybersecurity to other domains—national, food, physical, affective,
and moral security—to distill and analyze similarities and differences in how
domains understand security. There were three areas where the security
literature notably differs. First, whether security is understood in terms of
objective or subjective elements. Second, what value security implicates and
whether that value is instrumental or inherent. Third, whether security
attaches to individuals, unstructured groups (people with shared identities),
structured groups (organizations, institutions), or objects. Among the domains
we explored, cybersecurity was unique in seeing itself as (merely)
instrumentally valuable, thinking about security in solely objective terms, and
treating objects as the ultimate subject of security. Looking to other domains
reminds us that security is inherently valuable, includes a subjective
component, and is ultimately about people.
