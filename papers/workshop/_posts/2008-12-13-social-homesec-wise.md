Hackers have learned to leverage the enormous number of poorly protected home computers by turning them into a large
distributed system (known as a botnet), making home computers an important frontier for security research. They present
special problems: owners are unsophisticated, and usage profiles are varied making onesize-fits-all firewall policies
ineffective. We propose a social firewall that collects security decisions and both user and usage characteristics, and
provides users with personalized information to assist with allow/deny recommendations. To succeed, a social firewall
must deal with at least three user behavior issues: why contribute private information? why make effort to provide
quality information? and, how to prevent manipulation by adversaries? We sketch an incentive-centered design approach to
each problem. We provide an economic model and some analytic results for a solution to the fundamental problem: why
contribute? We show that an excludable public goods mechanism can achieve a better outcome than a system without social
motivators.
