Email remains one of the most widely used methods of communication globally.
However, successful phishing email attacks and subsequent costs remain
unreasonably high despite technical advances in defenses that limit phishing
scams. In this paper, we examine human detection of phishing. We found that
non-experts go through four different sensemaking processes to determine if an
email is a phishing message; they use different knowledge and skills to become
suspicious differently in each process. Additionally, non-experts rely on their
social connections as an investigative tool to determine if an email is a
phishing scam. We discuss the impact of our findings on phishing training and
technology.
