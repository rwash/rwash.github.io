One of the largest preventable sources of computer compromise is old software
that has not been updated with the latest security-related updates. Security
updates correct known vulnerabilities in software and protect the computer from
future attacks. However, users do not always choose to install updates;
instead, they avoid or delay installation, placing their computers and data at
an increased risk of of harm. Our research explores different mental models
users have regarding software updates and connects those models to the past
update behavior of participants. We used a multi-method approach to collect
interview, survey, and computer log data from 37 Windows 7 users. We analysed
the qualitative data to understand how people conceptualized updates, and made
decisions regarding them. We observed a disconnect between participantsâ€™
understanding of update behavior and reality. Issues such as locus of control,
and the unknown consequences of updating software negatively impacted update
behavior.
