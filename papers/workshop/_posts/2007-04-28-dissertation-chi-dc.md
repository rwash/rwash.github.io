Home computer users frequently lack the skills necessary to ensure proper security.   Hackers exploit this to control
large networks of computers ('botnets') that are used for spam, extortion, and fraud.  I integrate ideas from psychology
and economics to design software that provides incentives that induce better security choices by home computer users.
