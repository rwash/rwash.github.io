**del.icio.us** is a website for "social bookmarking" where users can store and access their bookmarks online, along with
descriptive keywords or "tags." When a user of del.icio.us logs in to their account and adds a bookmark, she may also
tag that bookmark with any 10 or fewer single words that she feels are somehow related to that web page. Both the tags
and the bookmarks are then publicly available; searching by a tag produces all of the bookmarked web pages ever tagged
with that word. Because the tags are public, it is possible that usersâ€™ choices regarding what tags to apply could be
influenced by the tagging practices of others, and a consensus might emerge for which tags should be used in a given
context. However, it has long been accepted that people use language imprecisely, and meaning is negotiated on-the-fly
during conversation. This imprecision is evident not only in communication, but also when people are asked to create
keywords for recipes and names for common editing operations, and when user-generated index terms are compared with
Library of Congress subject headings. In fact, the probability that two people will generate the same label for the same
object is widely held to be less than 20%.

A question remains about whether users of del.icio.us practice social or selfish tagging. An analysis of bookmark, user
and tag data for 349 web pages downloaded via del.icio.us was conducted to discover whether the "vocabulary problem" is
present in the way users select tags for web pages. Results indicate that there is very little inter-user agreement,
suggesting that most users consciously or inadvertently tag selfishly. These tagging practices have important
implications for the findability of web pages in del.icio.us.
