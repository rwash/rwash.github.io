Recent research suggests that stories and storytelling can be used to help people make better security decisions. We are interested in using stories as a way to influence users to voluntarily enable two-factor authentication on their accounts. We conducted three studies that each focused on a different story type that would attempt to help users identify with the stories and lead to voluntary adoption of Two-factor. We presented these stories to samples from MTurk and Qualtrics and examined their reactions. We found that overall the stories were effective in convincing users to be willing to adopt two-factor authentication; however, our attempts to narrow in on the mechanism that made the stories effective alluded us.
