I am an Associate Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in the [Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu).

My research focuses on understanding how people think about and reason about their use of technology, with particular
focuses on information security, crowdsourcing, and online communities.

### Short Bio

Rick Wash is an expert on the human aspects of cybersecurity.  

He is an Associate Professor in the Information School at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He studies how people
think about their interactions with modern technology, with an emphasis on the work people do to protect themselves from
risks associated with using information technology and the Internet.  

His research has won the Impact award at SOUPS for significant long-term impact on the usable security and privacy
research and practice, a Google Security and Privacy Research award, and an NSF CAREER award. His work is supported by
over $2 million from the US National Science Foundation. He was previously a professor at Michigan State University, and
he completed his PhD at the School of Information at the University of Michigan. 


 <!-- Prior to studying information, Rick completed
his masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, and his
bachelors degree in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University. -->

### Longer Life Story

At one time in my past, I wanted to be a programmer.   Actually, for most of my teenage years and through college, I
dreamed of working somewhere cool like Microsoft (Google wasn't around yet).   I loved building stuff; I still remember
writing my first computer program and being amazed that the computer was doing what I told it to.  When I got to college
I was programming computers on a regular basis as a Computer Science major.  But I ran into one small problem:  I knew
how to make it do stuff, but I didn't know what to make it do.

So I went to grad school hoping to learn how to come up with great new things for the computer to do.  But the longer I
was there, the more I realized that computers are really here to serve people, and you need to understand how people use
computers to know what to build.  Since then I've been spending most of my time learning more and more about how people
use and interact with computers.   In particular, in recent years we've seen an explosion of people using computers to
interact with other people; social media systems like FaceBook, YouTube, Wikipedia, and Delicious are all seeing
enormous growth.  And all of these sites are great because they understand how to get people to work together and
interact in valuable ways.

My work right now focuses on looking at how computers enable and encourage people to interact with each other in
valuable ways.  In particular, I focus on strategic interactions: times when how you use the computer affects how I want
to use the computer, and my use of the computer affects you.  These types of interactions happen all the time right now;
you probably already have Facebook open in another window to check if any friends have updated their status.  YouTube
wouldn't be very interesting if people didn't upload videos, but no video creator would upload anything if there wasn't
anyone there to watch it.  And Wikipedia is probably the most complex of them all, with authors, readers, editors,
administrators, project coordinators, and so on.

When there are complex strategic interactions, designing the software becomes really difficult.   How do you design a
website where users will collaborate to write encyclopedia entries?  What features will encourage that collaboration,
and what features will discourage it?  This is a hard question and requires both an understanding of people and an
understanding of technology.  This is where my work comes in.  I am trying to identify incentive mechanisms: technology
features or design patterns that have predictable behavorial consequences in these complex strategic environments.
These design patterns will allow us to build the next generation of social computing systems.
